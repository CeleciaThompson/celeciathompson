		<p>
		Celecia Thomspon may be described differently based on who you ask. However, you guys will be the first to know who she is based on her personalty traits.
		Celecia is a person that many may describe as miserable, moody and provoking and she is definitely all of those. Celecia also has another side of being determined, consistent and even nonchalant.
		It is safe to say that she is an introvert because most times she is by herself in her own world either drawing, writing out her feelings or trying to structure her future.
		The fact that many persons have differnt perspectives of who Celecia is she went ahead and took a personality test online and she is excited to see the results.

		I personally believe that the test does have some type of validity in general seeing that you were the one that answered the given questions. 
		Based on the personality test I agree that some of the results were true.
		This is so because I am definitely an introvert, I am also not as dependent, I am definitely not materialistic and I am also a bit paranoid at times. 
		However, I do not believe that  I am  that much of a narcissist. With that being said, the test does have a mixture of validity and errors.
