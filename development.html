		<p>
		This page will consist of me briefly describing <mark>my strengths </mark>and how I have been developing in the areas in the last three to five years of my life.
		
		<br/>
		<br/>
		
		<b>&nbsp; <u> Strengths </u></b>
		<br/>
		
		<ul>
		<li> I believe that my main strength is the ability to do hair. I am very good at doing hairstyles and I learn how to do new styles quickly.
		I definitely have been developing in the field because I practice occasionally and try to do styles that I never do before. </li>
	<br/>
	
	<li> I can decorate and transform a room drastically. I browse daily about the different ways in which I can change up a room and how to add different pieces of decor to a room in order to make it look different. 
	Browsing daily for different ideas is one way in which I develope on that skill.</li>
	<br/>
	
	<li> I can also write a good story. Over the past three to five years I was writing short stories daily,however, in the past year I really have not been writing short stories because of personal problems. 
	However, I have been writing out my feelings more and I think this still helps with developing my writing skills. </li>
		</ul>
		
		<b><u>Summary of the Twelve Pillars</u></b>
		<br/>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; It is powerful to write <strong>goals</strong> because when it is written it is then brought to reality.Your brain will automatically remember those goals and push you towards them which will lead to you eventually achieving them. To set your goals the first step is to write it down. 
		There are four types of goals according to Mr. Davis, there is long-term goal, mid-range goal, short-range goal and micro-goals; even though the length of each goal is different each goal leads you to the next.
        <br/>
		
		&nbsp; &nbsp; It is also said that <strong>time management</strong> is important because time goes by fast. This means when you might think you do not have time, you do because everyday is another other opportunity so spend each day wisely. 
        In order to be successful it is important to surround yourself with persons that are strong minded and has the same goal as you do.
        This is so because every relationship you have is an association, and it has either a positive, neutral or negative effect on you. It is advised that you categorize each person that you associate with because in order to be successful you have to hang around successful persons to gain that sense of competition to be a better version of yourself and to have a better attitude.
       <br/>
	   

	  &nbsp; &nbsp;  However, in order to be successful you have to be a <strong>life long learner</strong> because learning does not stop at formal education, it goes a long way. In order to continue learning you have to read books, observe successful persons and learn from your experiences.
        <br/>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; I will definitely apply these lessons to my life because it truly opened my eyes and taught me a lot. I will absolutely categorize my friends and spend my time wise because it goes by quickly. This means that I will spend less time discussing less important things with friends, procastinating and go ahead and associate with persons that are in the same mind set as I am.
		I will continue to work towards my short term goals that were set for this year and go ahead with writing my mid-term and long term goals because I want to feel the power when those goals are achieved.
